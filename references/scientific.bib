  abstract="Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have attracted attention in the support of safe driving, intelligent navigation, and emergency and entertainment applications. VANET can be viewed as an intelligent component of the Transportation Systems as vehicles communicate with each other as well as with roadside base stations located at critical points of the road, such as intersections or construction sites. In this paper, we provide an overview of the context-aware processing and communication gateway associated with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). The concept of context-awareness, the recent advances and various challenges involved in context-aware processing are discussed. Some arising ideas such as based on context ontology, relevancy, hybrid dissemination, service oriented routing are also presented. This paper further briefly describes the communication gateway in VANET which includes its functional view together with the standards and their detailed preliminary specifications applicable to VANET.",
